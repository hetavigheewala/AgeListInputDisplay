# AgeListInputDisplay

This Python code initializes an empty list called "students." It then prompts the user to input age values for 5 individuals and adds each age value to the "students" list. After collecting the age values, the code displays the entered age values one by one on separate lines, effectively printing out the contents of the "students" list. This code allows the user to input and display age values for a group of people, making it useful for recording and presenting age-related information in a simple and organized manner.
